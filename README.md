New book <em>Gentle Introduction To Chaotic Dynamical Systems</em>, under contruction. For now, the following is available:
<ul>
  <li> The Python scripts <code>Brownian.py</code> and <code>brownian_reflective.py</code> are used and described in chapter 1, available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2023/02/11/random-walks-brownian-motions-and-related-stochastic-processes/">here</a>. The title of this chapter is <em>Random Walks, Brownian Motions, and Related Stochastic Processes</em>. From the same link, you can download this chapter.
  <li> The Python scripts <code>chaos_solveFunctional.py</code>, <code>chaos_2D_base.py</code>, and <code>basin.py</code> are used and described in chapter 2, available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2023/02/21/introduction-to-discrete-chaotic-dynamical-systems/">here</a>. The title of this chapter is <em>Introduction to Discrete Chaotic Dynamical Systems</em>. From the same link, you can download this chapter.
</ul>

This new book will integrate much of the content from my older book <em>Applied Stochastic Processes, Chaos Modeling, and Probabilistic Properties of Numeration Systems</em> is available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/resources/">here</a>. In addition, there will be a lot of new material.
